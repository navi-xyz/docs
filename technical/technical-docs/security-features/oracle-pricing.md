# Oracle Pricing

The platform utilizes a variety of oracle providers to ensure secure, reliable, and scalable price feeds for all supported assets. These oracles ensure accurate pricing information, which is essential for determining collateral value and enforcing platform security mechanisms.

Considering also our interest in supporting exotic assets, and yield-bearing tokens, we plan as well on integration with a variety of DEXes and develop custom oracles for these assets.&#x20;

The third-party oracles we are currently using are:

* Supra
* Pyth
