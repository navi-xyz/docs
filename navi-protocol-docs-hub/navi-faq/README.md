# NAVI FAQ

## What is NAVI Protocol?

NAVI is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers. Suppliers provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralised (perpetually) fashion.

## How do I interact with NAVI Protocol?

In order to interact with NAVI protocol, you simply supply your preferred asset and amount. After supplying, you will earn passive income based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, supplying assets allows you to borrow by using your supplied assets as a collateral. Any interest you earn by supplying funds helps offset the interest rate you accumulate by borrowing.

## What is the cost of using NAVI Protocol?

Interacting with the protocol requires transactions and so transaction fees for Sui Blockchain usage, which depend on the network status and transaction complexity. Sui fees are generally very low, so only a small amount of SUI tokens are needed for interacting with NAVI Protocol.

## Where are the funds stored?

Your funds are allocated in a smart contract. The code of the smart contract is public, open source, formally verified, and audited by third party auditors. You can withdraw your funds from the pool on-demand, and there is no one who is ever in control over your funds.

## What are the risks associated with NAVI Protocol?

The Navi team takes security very seriously and no code will be deployed without extensive reviews, testing, and audits. However there are risks inherent to participating in any Web3 DeFi platform, including:

* Smart contract risk due to unforeseen bugs that are not caught by our stringent security policies.
* Oracle risk due to oracle manipulation.
* Blockchain risk. If the underlying blockchain is somehow compromised, NAVI Protocol cannot protect user funds.

## Why was NAVI Protocol created?

NAVI Protocol was created to build delightful user experiences on the fledgling Sui DeFi ecosystem and take advantage of the desirable features of the Move VM.

## Who is behind NAVI Protocol?

The team behind NAVI Protocol is a seasoned team of founders and builders from the blockchain development space with many collective years of experience building and running protocols across DeFi and Web3 infrastructure.
