# Supplying and Earning

## How do I supply?

Browse to the "Supply" section and click on "Supply" for the asset you want to supply. Select the amount you'd like to supply and submit your transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed, your supply is successfully registered and you begin earning interest.

## How much will I earn?

Depositors receive continuous earnings that evolve with market conditions based on:

* **The interest rate payment on loans** - suppliers share the interests paid by borrowers corresponding to the average borrow rate times the utilisation rate. The higher the utilisation of a reserve the higher the yield for suppliers.

Each asset has its own market of supply and demand with its own APY (Annual Percentage Yield) which evolves with time. You can find the average annual rate over the past 30 days to evaluate the rate evolution, and you can also find more data on the reserve overview of each asset in the home section on the app.

## Is there a minimum or maximum amount to supply?

You can supply any amount you want, there is no minimum or maximum limit.

## How do I withdraw?

To withdraw you need to go to the "Dashboard" section and click on “Withdraw”. Select the amount to withdraw and submit the transaction.&#x20;

You would need to make sure there is enough liquidity (not borrowed) in order to withdraw, if this is not the case you would need to wait for more liquidity from suppliers or borrowers repaying. This is a rare scenario that occurs only if you have a very large position which comprises a large percentage of the pool, or the pool is very highly utlizied, in which case there is an incentive for others to deposit.
